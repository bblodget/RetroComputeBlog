title: FinalGROM99

So I finally got around to trying the TI99/4a [FinalGROM99](https://endlos99.github.io/finalgrom99/) cartridge.
Here it is:

![FinalGROM99]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-03-17/fgrom99_cart.jpg "FinalGROM99")

This is a multicart cartridge in that multiple cartridges can be stored on
a single cartridge. It succeeds the [FlashROM99](https://endlos99.github.io/flashrom99) 
released in 2016.
The [FinalGROM99 github site](https://github.com/endlos99/finalgrom99) says that it is released as
Open Source Hardware under the [CERN OHL license](http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cernohl/wiki) 
and the [GNU GPL license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). It is (c) 2017
Ralph Benzinger.

I bought mine from [The Brewing Academy](https://thebrewingacademy.com/).  It came 
in a 3D printed cartridge shell with a printed instruction manual and catalog.

## How to use

Basically you put cartridge dumps or other images files onto a SD (FAT16) or SDHC (FAT32) card.
SDHX cards won't work.  You can put the images into folders to organize them. For best
performance it is best to copy all the files at once.
Then you put the SD card into the FinalGROM99
cartridge, insert the cartridge into the TI and turn it on.  You can
then use the built-in menu system to select the binary you want to run.

![FinalGROM99 Menu4]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2019-03-17/fgrom99_menu4.jpg "FinalGROM99 Menu4")

It appears the binary then is copied from the SD card to the SRAM.
It is like that cartridge has been installed.  If you do a warm restart,
FCTN-=/+, or press the FinalGROM99 right button (closest to middle of cartridge), you
don't get the FinalGROM99 menu instead you, get the select cartridge menu items.

If you want to get back to the FinalGROM99 menu, you can either
power off the computer and power it back on or press the FinalGROM99 left
button (closest to edge of cartridge), after a warm restart.

## How it works

The cartridge itself has a Cypress 1MB SRAM, Xilinx CPLD XC95144XL, and an Atmel ATmega
328P. It also has a SD card socket and 2 micro push buttons. The 1MB SRAM is divided into
128 banks of 8KB each. The CPLD implements all of the cartridge logic.  The ATmega 328
reads the SD card.  The ATmega 328 uses a modified version of the [Petit FatFS](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_p.html).

## Giving it a try

It works very well for game cartridges.  I got to try many games
that I never played before such as Beyond Parsec, Burger Time, Munchman II,
Robotron:2084 and many others.

I was excited to try the development tools as well,  such as the Mini Memory,
FBForth, and TurboForth.  Unfortunately the Forth's are limited because
they require libraries to be loaded from disk.  Likewise the Mini Memory
needs the line assembler to be loaded from cassette.
