I’ve submitted an entry for the RetroChallenge 2019/03!

My entry is to create a way for the TI-99/4a computer to control a "compute cluster".  My
compute cluster is named Munchman named after the classic TI game.
[Munchman](https://github.com/ClusterFights/MunchMan) has been participating in monthly
[ClusterFight competitions](http://clusterfights.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) and has
been kicking butt!  I think it would be fun if I could command the cluster from an actual
TI-994a computer.

I have not programmed a TI-99/4a since I was a kid in the 80's.  So the first step will be to
re-familiarize myself with the machine and research potential solutions.
